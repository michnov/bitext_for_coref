----------------------
- moved all files in coref_bitext from tectomt_svn to tectomt(_git)
- inspecting autoamtically parsed (src) PCEDT documents and making a statistics: analysis/notes
    - unexpressed arguments of verbs in en_src are missing
        - data/analysed/pcedt/train/wsj_0003.final.treex.gz##1, exposed, used
        - TODO: they should be filled in even by a naive rule
    - Czech relative pronoun coreference resolver does not check agreement in gender and number
        - data/analysed/pcedt/train/wsj_0003.final.treex.gz##1, kteri
        - TODO: fix it

14-16.2.2014
----------------------
- back to bitext_coref resolution
- preparing experiments for ACL2014 paper - perspron bitext coref resolution
    - supervised alignment
        - scripts for generating the data
        - annotating training data
            - from PCEDT Section 19
            - annot/en_perspron/align.ref.sec19.misko.annot
            - stopped at the line matching "^\*"
            - TODO: check trees for "^[+?]" files

17.2.2014
----------------------
- generating tables for ML
    - English coreference resolution (ranking)
        - anaphor candidates: English personal pronouns (including the reflexives)
    - train_00-18: PCEDT Sections 00-18
        - in /home/mnovak/projects/czeng_coref/data/en/train_00-18.pcedt_bi.en.analysed.table

18.2.2014
----------------------
- ML loops
    - in /home/mnovak/projects/czeng_coref
- discussing with Zdenek
    - the drop after adding Charniak's features is strange
        - there was a bug
            - conflicts in files named using a hash of the current date
        - TODO: should be checked by cross-validation
    - another baseline experiment
        - just copy Czech links to English
        - Loganathan's experiment: Tamil text -> MT -> English transl -> parser -> English tree -> projection -> Tamil projected tree
            - bad performance
            - however, if a parser was trained on the Tamil projected tree, they got an 8% improvement

19.2.2014
---------------------
- fixed the ML framework bug
    - tmp files are named after process id $$, not the current date
