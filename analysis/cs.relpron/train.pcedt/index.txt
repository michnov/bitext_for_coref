* Czech relative pronouns (gram_indeftype eq "relat") can be expressed in English by the following means:
    * 'ref' zones are under investigation here
        * but the set of instances is defined by being a relative pronoun in 'src' zone
    * created as follows:
        1) get the child of an English node (most likely a verb) aligned with the Czech relpron's parent (likely a verb)
           that holds the same functor as the Czech relpron
            * an approach that was found benefitial in case of searching for counterparts to "it"
            * this can reveal also the generated nodes which are rarely aligned with something - #Cor in a coreference of control
            * error NO_EN_REF_PAR if the parent is not aligned
            * error NO_EN_REF_FUNCTOR_TNODE if no child having a desired functor
            * error BAD_EN_REF_FUNCTOR_TNODE if a child with the desired functor is none of the following: relpron, #Cor, #PersPron
        2) if NO_EN_REF_FUNCTOR_TNODE or BAD_EN_REF_FUNCTOR_TNODE, take the only child which is coreferential with something 
            * error NO_EN_REF_COREF_CHILDREN if no coreferential child
            * error MANY_EN_REF_COREF_CHILDREN if many coreferential children
        3) try to find it directly by the alignment of the Czech replron itself
            * aims at discovering mostly relative pronouns which failed to be revealed mostly due to NO_EN_REF_PAR error
            * error NO_EN_REF_TNODE if nothing aligned
            * error NORELAT_EN_REF_TNODE if the aligned node is not a relpron
        4) searching for appositive patterns denoted <NO_VERB_APPOS>
            * neither a relative pronoun nor an aligned verb present on the English side
            * an #EmpVerb or APPOS appears as a parent among the counterparts of the relpron's siblings
            * error NOEMPVERBAPPS_EN_REF_PARS if there is no such a parent

* the accuracy (TODO: or P-R-F) of relative pronoun anaphora resolution in Czech:
    * all:
        * analysis/cs.relpron/train.pcedt/scores.all
        * true=0 
            * analysis/cs.relpron/train.pcedt/nodes.0_ref.list
            * for words like "jaky", "co", "kolik", "kdy" etc.
            * in patterns like "riziko ztr√°ty toho, co je ..."
            * treats "Co." as a pronoun "co"
    * in English expressed as:
        1) relative pronoun
        2) participle
        3) TODO: ...

* the accuracy of resolution by projection via alignment from English
    * all:
    * in English expressed as:

* the agreement on the antecedents between the languages:
    * best calculated by pointwise precision, recall (accuracy should very similar for relpron anaphora):
        CS: CA1 CA2 <---- CF
                 |
        EN:     EA1 <---- EF
        Precision = 1/1
        Recall = 1/2
