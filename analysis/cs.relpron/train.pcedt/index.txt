* Czech relative pronouns (gram_indeftype eq "relat") can be expressed in English by the following means:
    * 'ref' zones are under investigation here
        * but the set of instances is defined by being a relative pronoun in 'src' zone
    * created as follows:
        1) try to find it directly by the alignment of the Czech replron itself
            * aims at discovering mostly relative pronouns which failed to be revealed mostly due to NO_EN_REF_PAR error
            * error NO_EN_REF_TNODE if nothing aligned
                * relative pronouns are usually considered auxilliary - "po te, co", "od te doby, co"
            * error NORELAT_EN_REF_TNODE if the aligned node is not a relpron
        2) get the child of an English node (most likely a verb) aligned with the Czech relpron's parent (likely a verb)
           that holds the same functor as the Czech relpron
            * an approach that was found benefitial in case of searching for counterparts to "it"
            * this can reveal also the generated nodes which are rarely aligned with something - #Cor in a coreference of control
            * error NO_EN_REF_PAR if the parent is not aligned
            * error NO_EN_REF_FUNCTOR_TNODE if no child having a desired functor
            * error BAD_EN_REF_FUNCTOR_TNODE if a child with the desired functor is none of the following: relpron, #Cor, #PersPron
        3) if NO_EN_REF_FUNCTOR_TNODE or BAD_EN_REF_FUNCTOR_TNODE, take the only child which is coreferential with something 
            * error NO_EN_REF_COREF_CHILDREN if no coreferential child
            * error MANY_EN_REF_COREF_CHILDREN if many coreferential children
        4) accesing the English counterparts through siblings
            * error NO_EN_REF_SIBLINGS if nothing aligned to siblings
            * error NO_EN_REF_SIBLINGS if siblings' counterpart have many parents
            * error NOFORMEME_EN_REF_PAR if parent has no formeme
            * if parent's formeme is a noun: <NOUN_ANTE_ATTR>: turns into the attribute of the noun (the antecedent)
            * if parent's formeme is a verb and it has a single relpron or #Cor node
            * error MANYCOR_EN_REF_PAR: many #cor nodes
            * error BADFORMEME_EN_REF_PAR if parent's formeme is neither n.* nor v.* (with the assumptions mentioned above)
            * the parent is a noun => 
        5) searching for appositive patterns denoted <NO_VERB_APPOS>
            * neither a relative pronoun nor an aligned verb present on the English side
            * an #EmpVerb or APPOS appears as a parent among the counterparts of the relpron and its siblings
            * error NOEMPVERBAPPS_EN_REF_PARS if there is no such a parent

    * 8/10 NORELAT_EN_REF_TNODE,NO_EN_REF_PAR,NOALIGN_CS_REF_SIBLINGS errors are patterns like (data/analysed/pcedt/train/wsj_1186.final.treex.gz)
        EN: at $11.25 a share, up $1.125
        CS: za 11.25 dolaru na akcii, což bylo navýšení o 1125 dolaru
        => include the counterpart of the replron (usually "up") in appos search
        => <NO_VERB_APPOS> grabbing 6% of all cases
